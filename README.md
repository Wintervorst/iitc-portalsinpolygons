# iitc-portalsinpolygon
IITC plugin for displaying a list of portals in polygons, circles, and on lines.
The Portals-in-Polygon is a plugin for the [Ingress Intel Total Conversion](https://iitc.me/) web application and is used to 
display a list of portals in, and on the edges of, polygons and circles.  It wil also display the list of portals on lines.

The plugin also provides the ability to bring portals to the front draw layer so that you can click on them after drawing a 
circle or polygon over them.

# Installation
Currently, access to this plugin is for Ingress Resistance agents on an invite-only basis.  Contact me, Hayeswise, with your GitHub account.

I recommend you install Tampermonkey if you are using Chrome or Greasemonkey if you are using Firefox.

Download the latest version [**here**](https://github.com/hayeswise/iitc-poimarker/raw/master/wise-poimarker.user.js).  Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey will provide the install/reinstall page.  Click the install/reinstall button.

## Updating
If the plugin is already installed, it's easy to update in most cases.  Either click on the download link, above, or follow the these instructions from the IITC website:

### Chrome and Tampermonkey

_Open the Tampermonkey menu and choose "Check for userscript updates". If you have a lot of plugins, or other scripts installed, this can be a little slow. Wait 30 seconds, then try clicking the Tampermonkey icon again; if the menu opens, it's finished updating. Once complete, reload the Ingress intel map to use the new version._

### Firefox and Greasemonkey

_Open the Greasemonkey menu and choose "Manage user scripts". Now click the cog icon and choose "Check for updates". However, sometimes Greasemonkey fails to update all scripts. Check the date+time listed at the start of the description (e.g. "[jonatkins-2013-08-23-042102]") and if any have failed to update then manually download from the list below. Once updated, reload the Intel map and the new version will be active._
